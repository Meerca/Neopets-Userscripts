# Neopets Userscripts
This is a set of basic scripts to help out with UI enhancements on various parts of Neopets. Use at your own risk. I can't guarantee that Neopets won't take issue with you using these scripts.

As with any script provided by somebody else, I highly recommend that you *look through the source code* yourself to make sure there's nothing that will put your account at risk.

## Script Installation
Not tested in other browsers (but you can try installing Tampermonkey equivalents on the browser of your choice).

**Chrome**
1) Install the [Tapermonkey extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) from the Chrome Web Store. 
2) Click on the green "Install" button below to install the user scripts you're interested in using.

## The Scripts
