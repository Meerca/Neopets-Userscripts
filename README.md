# Neopets Userscripts
This is a set of basic scripts to help out with UI enhancements on various parts of Neopets. Use at your own risk. I can't guarantee that Neopets won't take issue with you using these scripts.

As with any script provided by somebody, I highly recommend that you *look through the source code* yourself to make sure there's nothing that will put your account at risk.
