## Requirements

### You must first install [the Tampermonkey extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) on Chrome

You may also be able to use this on other browsers using Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey equivalent extensions. These scripts have only been tested in Chrome on a computer (and not on any mobile devices).
